,,,,,,,
communication,q1-not-very-challenging,"I see that communication between you both is rather good and that you show a good understanding of your partner. I congratulate you on being open and able to talk to each other! However, there are always ways you can improve communication even more. Maybe you can try taking a trip to a completely different place to disconnect from your comfort zones. You might be surprised at what topics of conversation come about.",,,,,
communication,q1-moderately-challenging,"I understand that communication between you and your partner is not the easiest. However, there are many ways to help it get better, and it doesn’t have t be difficult. What I would suggest is that the next time you have a moment alone together, try talking through your emotions at that exact moment. Sharing your feelings should be something you can both regularly and openly talk about, and getting as much practise in will make it easier.",,,,,
communication,q1-highly-challenging,"I see that communication between you and your partner is difficult. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t work through it. I would suggest starting out by having a conversation where you take turns to talk uninterrupted for a minute each. Make sure you give one another the space to voice your opinions, listen carefully and then respond with the same respect. ",,,,,
communication,confession,"I would ike for you to turn to your partner, look at them. Really look at them. I want you to tell them how you feel. can can point out someting you like or somthing you dont like. Up to you.",,,,,

communication,q2,"the last time you discussed your problems or differences, did it lead to an argument or fight?",,,,,
communication,q2-no,"That’s really commendable, well done. It’s a real strength in relationships to be able to tell each other what’s on your mind and any annoyances or irritations you might have without it becoming a personal attack on either side. Keep it up and don’t be afraid to tackle comments about all subject areas. ",,,,,
communication,q2-yes,"On a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the most often, how often do your conversations turn into arguments?",,,,,
communication,frustrated,"You seem to have a lot of feeling bottled up inside, and I think you really need to concider seeing a human therapist. In the mean time you should concider talking about your feeling in a calm non asgressive manor. ",,,,,
communication,less-frustrated,I can see you are a bit frustrated.,,,,,
communication,nutral,Its good you keeping your thoughts in a positive state of mind.,,,,,
